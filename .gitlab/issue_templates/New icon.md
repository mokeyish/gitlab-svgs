<details><summary>See tasks:</summary>

<!-- This checklist helps streamline the process of getting an icon from Figma to the library. -->

1. [ ] Create a new merge request (MR) from this issue.
1. [ ] Checkout the new branch locally.
1. [ ] Export the icon component from the Pajamas UI Kit (in Figma) to the **/sprite_icons** folder in your local instance of the repo. The file name should be lowercase, and use hyphens as a separator between terms.
1. [ ] Open the SVG you just exported in your code editor and remove `fill="none"` from the `<svg>` element.
1. [ ] In a terminal window, run `yarn run dev` to preview the SVG library locally. Find the new icon and test it out by changing settings in the **Icon configuration** panel of the site. The icon should change color and size with no issues.
1. [ ] After you‚Äôve committed the changes and the pipeline passes, double-check your icon in the review app and test that it matches your expectations.
1. [ ] Assign the MR to be reviewed and merged by a [maintainer](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/projects/#gitlab-svgs), and proceed with any changes.
1. [ ] Add a read only (FYI) agenda item to the next [UX weekly
       call](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fSRyTboySDpWPrQiiFIcIOhg09-9G54haIippIVtcCY)

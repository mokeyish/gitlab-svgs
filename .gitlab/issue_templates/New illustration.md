## Purpose

<!-- Briefly describe the purpose and use case for the new illustration. -->

## Concept

<!-- Explain how the illustration aligns with the purpose and use. If metaphors are used, explain how they relate. If possible, provide screenshots of the illustration in context. You can also embed the SVG here for visual reference. -->

## Checklists

Complete all items in both checklists before closing the issue. All items are the responsibility of the author, unless otherwise noted.

### Design

<!-- This checklist ensures that illustrations are created and reviewed according to the guidelines and a predictable workflow. -->
1. [ ] Choose one of the following based on your contribution:
   - If you are a member of the GitLab team in Figma, start with a [branch](https://www.figma.com/best-practices/branching-in-figma/) of the [illustration][illustration-file] file in Figma. Prefix the branch name with the issue number, and add your GitLab username as the suffix. For example, **#120-feature-illustration-jelder**.
   - For a community contribution, duplicate the [illustration][illustration-file] file to your drafts in Figma.
1. [ ] Ensure that the illustration follows the [Illustration guidelines](https://design.gitlab.com/product-foundations/illustration). For third-party trademarks, please review the [third-party trademark usage guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/policies/product-third-party-trademarks-guidelines/).
1. [ ] Choose/copy a grid frame from the **Grid** page. Work on your illustration in the appropriate component or library page. A small illustration that can be used as a standalone "spot" illustration, or as a reusable element in a larger illustration can be added in the **Components** page, while all others can be added to the library page that makes the most sense.
1. [ ] Share your branch or draft file with a [FE/UX Foundation designer](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/?department=fe-ux-foundations-team) to review, and make sure they have view permissions in Figma. If they have the capacity, they should assign themselves to this issue. If not, try pinging another designer.
1. [ ] **Reviewer**: Review the illustration. Add design-specific comments in Figma to maintain context. Add general comments to this issue, including your approval status. Once approved, assign to a [Figma maintainer](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/projects/#design.gitlab.com) for final review.
1. [ ] **Maintainer:** Either merge the branch and publish library changes, or copy/paste the illustration from a draft file to the [illustration file][illustration-file] under the appropriate page and category. The frame name should match the exported file name (without the extension).

### Library addition

<!-- This checklist helps streamline the process of getting an illustration from Figma to the library. -->

1. [ ] Create a new merge request (MR) from this issue.
1. [ ] Checkout the new branch locally.
1. [ ] Export the illustration from the [illustration file][illustration-file] in Figma to the **/illustrations** folder in your local instance of the repo. The file name should be lowercase, and use hyphens as a separator between terms. If necessary, place the illustration in one of the sub-directories.
1. [ ] In a terminal window, run `yarn run dev` to preview the SVG library locally. Find the new illustration and ensure it is rendered accurately.
1. [ ] After youâ€™ve committed the changes and the pipeline passes, double-check your icon in the review app and test that it matches your expectations.
1. [ ] Assign the MR to a review by a [maintainer](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/projects/#gitlab-svgs), and proceed with any changes.

If you run into any problems, ensure that all other steps in the project [README](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-svgs/-/blob/main/README.md) have been followed.
